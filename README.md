# Composer-enabled Drupal template

This is A5's starting point for new Drupal 10 projects based on Pantheon's D10 upstream.

Unlike with earlier Pantheon upstreams, files such as Drupal Core that you are
unlikely to adjust while building sites are not in the main branch of the 
repository. Instead, they are referenced as dependencies that are installed by
Composer.

For more information and detailed installation guides, please visit the
Integrated Composer Pantheon documentation: https://pantheon.io/docs/integrated-composer
